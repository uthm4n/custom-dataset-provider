# custom-dataset-provider
Attempt uno at revamping the REST option list type that already exists. My version should allow greater extensibility and customization e.g. if paths need to be passed in to the datasource as their own option list. It provides an easy avenue to construct a valid OptionList object in Morpheus from any JSON dataset.
